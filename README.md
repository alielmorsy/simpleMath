# Simple Math

Simple Math is a library I build in my free time that should look like numpy but written in CPP. By supporting Slicing,
Views,reshaping, and basic operators. It should be very similar.

It still a demo project that I code from time to time. I aim to support all important functions in numpy in the demo.

## Operations:

- [x] Slicing.
- [x] Assigning (Still Doing Testing on it).
- [x] Reshaping.
- [X] Operations.
- [X] Repeating.
- [ ] Transpose.

## Note

Please know this is just a demo I am working only on the main features. Like how slicing work, how operation works, how
broadcasting. and optimize them to get maximum performance. That should teach me how I get max performance on math
operations.
