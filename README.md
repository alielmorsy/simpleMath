# Simple Math
Simple Math is a library I build in my free time that should look like numpy but written in CPP. By supporting Slicing, Views,reshaping, and basic operators. It should be very similar.

It still a demo project that I code from time to time. I aim to support all improtant functions in numpy in the demo.

## Operations:
- [x] Slicing.
- [x] Assigning (Still Doing Testing on it).
- [x] Reshaping.
- [ ] Operations.
- [ ] Transpose.
